          <p>Thousands of investors are being targeted daily by cryptocurrency fraudsters, losing millions to schemes that take advantage of workers’ hard-earned money and misinformation. One of the main drivers of these scams is social media, specifically YouTube, where creators, whether knowingly or unknowingly, promote scams to a huge number of viewers. Millions act upon their recommendations, and these creators drive investment decisions, often promoting questionable enterprises to a large audience without due care. This study investigates the developing problem of crypto fraud driven through influencers by analyzing psychological influences in audiences and ethical concerns deriving from endorsements that pose regulatory challenges.</p>

          <p>Distributed supply‑chain optimization demands algorithms that can cope with unreliable communication, unbounded messaging delays, and geographically dispersed agents, yet still guarantee convergence with practical rates. In this work, we introduce <strong>DAPD‑SCO</strong> (Distributed Asynchronous Primal–Dual Optimization Supply‑Chain Optimization), a fully asynchronous primal–dual scheme for network flow allocation over directed acyclic supply‑chain graphs. Each edge‑agent independently updates its local flow via projected gradient descent, while each retailer‑agent adjusts its dual multiplier via projected gradient ascent, using only potentially stale information of arbitrary sublinear delay. Under standard convexity and Slater’s conditions—and without any global synchronization or bounded‑delay assumptions—we prove almost sure convergence to a saddle point and establish an ergodic duality‑gap rate of \(O(K^{-1/2})\), matching centralized lower bounds. Our analysis leverages a Lyapunov‑based decomposition that cleanly isolates delay‑induced errors and handles time‑varying communication topologies, bounded noise, and drifting cost or capacity parameters. Extensive simulations on realistic three‑tier networks demonstrate that DAPD‑SCO outperforms synchronous primal–dual, Asynchronous Distributed Decision-Making (ADDM), and gradient‑push approaches, achieving faster convergence, lower communication overhead, and robust performance under packet loss and high staleness.</p>

          <p>Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark performance. We propose <em>Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto)</em>, a data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of “forget events”), then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40% at just 10% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5%. These results demonstrate that principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal cost to generative performance.</p>

          <p>This project details the economics behind developing a sodium-ion battery from extraction, purification, etc to implementation into the data center. Currently lithium-ion batteries are being used as the primary source of energy, this research compares the economics behind the production of both batteries and weights the pros and cons of both to present the sodium-ion battery as a subsitute. Factors like pollution, harm, and other factors are also considered.</p>
